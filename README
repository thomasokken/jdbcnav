Choose from the following Ant targets:

compile-boot:
Compiles the first-stage loader containing the custom class loader, and the
first-stage boot class, jdbcnavboot.Boot.

compile-main:
Compiles all the classes under jdbcnav.*, including the second-stage boot class
jdbcnav.Main.

compile-resources:
Creates jdbcnav/VERSION and jdbcnav/images/*, without using build.number.

compile-resources-release:
Creates jdbcnav/VERSION and jdbcnav/images/*.number.

jar:
Creates a jar file named "jdbcnav.jar", which contains JDBC Navigator, all of
Rhino, and a MANIFEST.MF with a Main-Class entry pointing to jdbcnavboot.Boot.

release-jar:
Like the "jar" target, except this one also uses build.number.

javadoc:
Creates javadoc documentation under "javadoc", which you can access by pointing
your browser at "javadoc/index.html" (relative to the project base directory).

clean:
Deletes all build targets; restores the project directory to its original
state.
