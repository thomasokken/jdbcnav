Can we add a BFILE editor? Well, the good news is that regardless of what the
lying Oracle Javadocs say, there are public constructors for BFILE. The problem
is that there are no setDirAlias() and setName() methods; all I can find is
setLocator(byte[]) (and there is a constuctor that takes a byte[] as its second
argument; I expect that is also a "locator"). From looking at the output of
getLocator(), this is definitely the ticket; unfortunately, the format of the
thing is undocumented, and I haven't figured it out yet. Here's the locator
returned by a BFILE with dirAlias 'BFILEDIR' and name 'Viewer.cc':
0 35 0 1 8 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 -28 -52 -47 37 0 8 66 70 73 76 69 68 73 82 0 9 86 105 101 119 101 114 46 99 99 
Seems like the first two bytes represent the length of what follows, and from
offset 16, we have the dirAlias followed by the name, each preceded by two
length bytes. It is the bit from offset 2 to offset 16 that has me stumped.

Re: BFILE, again: it would be nice if we could use Edit Cell to look at the
contents of the referenced file. Note that you cannot save data *to* a BFILE,
so there should be no "Apply to table" option in this case.

Recheck SQL script generation, particularly limitLineLength(). I modified that
function recently in order to make it smarter about breaking lines on spaces,
but I think that modification may well be evil. May need to bite the bullet and
actually figure out *exactly* where it is possible to insert line breaks in
SQL, i.e. where do tokens begin and end etc.

Make "Reload Tree", "Clear Cache", and "Remove Orphans" scriptable, so that
you can mix the SQL embedding and the JDBCNav functionality in one script --
this could be useful for testing etc.
