    <h1>JDBC Navigator</h1>
    <h3>A free database browser and editor</h3>
    JDBC Navigator is a free database browser and editor. It lets you open JDBC
    database connections, browse schemas and tables, traverse relations by
    finding rows referencing a row's primary key, traverse relations by finding
    rows referenced by a row's foreign keys, edit table data (inserting new
    rows, and editing or deleting existing rows). When you edit two or more
    related tables, JDBC Navigator will automatically commit all edits in the
    right order so as not to violate any constraints at any time.
    <br>
    JDBC Navigator runs interactive queries and table loading operations in the
    background, so the application stays responsive while the query is in
    progress; you can pause or cancel an incomplete query at any time, and you
    can also edit incompletely-loaded tables without having to wait for the
    query to finish.
    <br>
    You can copy and paste rows between tables; when you perform the paste
    operation, you can specify how to map the source table's columns to the
    destination's. You can also save the contents of a table to a CSV file,
    which you can import into Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet programs,
    and you can import CSV files into a table; when you perform the import, you
    can specify how to map the file's columns to the table's.
    <br>
    You can create snapshots of tables or sets of tables, and you can save
    those snapshots to disk. Snapshots act like read-only databases; you can
    browse them just like a regular JDBC connection.
    <br>
    You can compare two databases, and generate SQL scripts that will transform
    one database into the other (as long as they have identical table
    structures), or generate scripts that will re-create a schema from scratch.
    You can use these scripts as a platform-neutral way of copying tables from
    one database to another, assuming that the target database has a facility
    to run SQL scripts.
    <br>
    You can also open a SQL window where you can interactively type SQL
    statements, rather like a terminal, except the window is also a text editor
    so you can easily tweak your statements and rerun them, and save them to
    disk so you can reuse them later.
    <br>
    There's also an embedded JavaScript interpreter, which you can use to load
    tables, edit their contents, and query their meta-data; the JavaScript
    interpreter allows you to access the same underlying data objects that are
    displayed on the screen, so you can load tables interactively, then
    manipulate their data using JavaScript procedures, and so on. You can also
    run SQL commands from JavaScript code, using the provided embedding of the
    <code>java.sql.Statement</code>, <code>java.sql.PreparedStatement</code>,
    and <code>java.sql.CallableStatement</code> interfaces. See <a
    href="javascript_embedding.txt">here</a> for details.
    <p>
    Compatibility: JDBC Navigator supports
    <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/">DB2</a>,
    <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Derby</a>,
    <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>,
    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a>,
    <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>,
    <a href="http://www.smallsql.de/">SmallSQL</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.transaction.de">Transbase</a>.
    <p>
    Interested? <b>Download</b> <a href="download.html">jdbcnav.jar</a>, which
    contains JDBC Navigator and <a
    href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> (a free-as-in-speech
    JavaScript engine, used by JDBC Navigator).
    <br>
    In addition to this, you will need JDBC drivers for your databases. These
    should be provided by your RDBMS vendor. For Oracle, the file to look for
    is called <code>classes12.zip</code> or <code>classes12.jar</code>.
    <br>
    Did I mention JDBC Navigator is a Java application? You will need Java to
    run this thing; <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Sun's JDK or JRE</a>,
    version 1.4 or later, will do the job.
    <p>
    How to use: put <code>jdbcnav.jar</code> wherever you like; cd to that
    directory and say
    <p>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -jar jdbcnav.jar</code>
    <p>
    Alternatively, you may also be able to launch JDBC Navigator by simply
    double-clicking the jdbcnav.jar icon in the Windows Explorer or Macintosh
    Finder.
    <p>
    Before opening any database connections, you will have to tell JDBC
    Navigator how to find your JDBC drivers. To do this, select
    <code>Preferences</code> from the <code>Navigator</code> menu, and add the
    drivers' <code>zip</code> or <code>jar</code> files to the <code>Class
    Path</code> list.
    <br>
    If you are accessing multiple databases, and some of those databases are
    different versions of one vendor's product (e.g., you want to access an
    Oracle 8 and an Oracle 9 database at the same time), you may experience
    problems if you try to put each of the applicable versions of that vendor's
    JDBC driver in the classpath at the same time. To avoid these problems,
    always use the most recent version of that vendor's JDBC driver in such
    cases. (Again assuming you want to access Oracle 8 and Oracle 9 databases
    simultaneously, don't use the Oracle 8 and Oracle 9 drivers at the same
    time; the Oracle 9 driver knows how to talk to Oracle 8 databases, so just
    use that one, and don't put the Oracle 8 driver in the classpath.)
    <p>
    <b>This version of JDBC Navigator (build 2450, dated 7 Dec 2005) is
    available free-as-in-speech (GNU Copyleft)</b>. You can download the source
    code (<a href="download-src.html">jdbcnav.tgz</a>) and tinker with it
    yourself if you wish.

    <h3>Quick Tour</h3>
    The following screen shots were taken while running JDBC Navigator under
    Microsoft Windows. If you run it under a different operating system, the
    look and feel of the user interface will be different (but the
    functionality, and the user interface layout, will be the same).
    <br>
    You can select which look and feel you want to use by selecting
    <code>Preferences</code> from the <code>Navigator</code> menu, and then
    selecting the desired option from the menu in the top left corner of the
    dialog.
