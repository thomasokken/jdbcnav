    <h3>JDBC Navigator</h3>
    JDBC Navigator is a free database browser and editor. It lets you open JDBC
    database connections, browse schemas and tables, find rows referencing a
    row's primary key, find rows referenced by a row's foreign keys, and edit
    table data (inserting new rows, and editing or deleting existing rows).
    <br>
    You can copy and paste rows between tables; when you perform the paste
    operation, you can specify how to map the source table's columns to the
    destination's. You can also save the contents of a table to a CSV file,
    which you can import into Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet programs,
    and you can import CSV files into a table; when you perform the import, you
    can specify how to map the file's columns to the table's.
    <br>
    You can create snapshots of tables or sets of tables, and you can save
    those snapshots to disk. Snapshots act like read-only databases; you can
    browse them just like a regular JDBC connection.
    <br>
    You can compare two databases, and generate SQL scripts that will transform
    one database into the other (as long as they have identical table
    structures), or generate scripts that will re-create a schema from scratch.
    You can use these scripts as a platform-neutral way of copying tables from
    one database to another, assuming that the target database has a facility
    to run SQL scripts.
    <br>
    You can also open a SQL window where you can interactively type SQL
    statements, rather like a terminal, except the window is also a text editor
    so you can easily tweak your commands and rerun them, and save them to disk
    so you can reuse them later.
    <br>
    There's also an embedded JavaScript interpreter, through which you can
    access the contents of table editing windows.

    Interested? Download <a href="jdbcnav.zip">jdbcnav.zip</a> (1241421 bytes;
    MD5 checksum: 4183416af61f890832137e92c4b9c3eb), which contains JDBC
    Navigator, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> (a
    free-as-in-speech JavaScript engine), and <a
    href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/">Xerces</a> (a free-as-in-speech XML
    parser). JDBC Navigator needs Rhino and Xerces to be in the classpath.
    <br>
    In addition to this, you will need JDBC drivers for your databases. These
    should be provided by your RDBMS vendor. For Oracle, the file to look for
    is called <code>classes12.zip</code> or <code>classes12.jar</code>.
    <br>
    Did I mention JDBC Navigator is a Java application? You will need Java to
    run this thing; <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Sun's JDK or JRE</a>,
    version 1.2.2 or later, will do the job (1.4 or later recommended).
    <p>
    How to use: put the jar files from <code>jdbcnav.zip</code>, and the JDBC
    driver(s), in one directory; cd to that directory and say
    <p>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java -classpath
    jdbcnav.jar;js.jar;xerces.jar;classes12.jar
    thomas.jdbcnavigator.JDBCNavigator</code>
    <p>
    If you are using Unix, replace the semicolons in the above command with
    colons.
    <br>
    Note: the above example assumes you are using Oracle 9; if you are using a
    different RDBMS, replace <code>classes12.jar</code> with the appropriate
    JDBC driver.
    <br>
    Also note: if you want to access more than one database at the same time,
    and if those databases require different JDBC drivers, just put all those
    drivers in the classpath.
    <br>
    If you are accessing multiple databases, and some of those databases are
    different versions of one vendor's product (e.g., you want to access an
    Oracle 8 and an Oracle 9 database at the same time), you may experience
    problems if you try to put each of the applicable versions of that vendor's
    JDBC driver in the classpath at the same time. To avoid these problems,
    always use the most recent version of that vendor's JDBC driver in such
    cases. (Again assuming you want to access Oracle 8 and Oracle 9 databases
    simultaneously, don't use the Oracle 8 and Oracle 9 drivers at the same
    time; the Oracle 9 driver knows how to talk to Oracle 8 databases, so just
    use that one, and don't put the Oracle 8 driver in the classpath.)
    <p>
    <b>This version of JDBC Navigator (build 790, dated 9/7/2002) is available
    free-as-in-beer, but it is copyrighted</b>. I'm not publishing the
    source code yet. I'm still debating whether or not to turn this into a
    commercial product. Even if I decide to go the commercial route, I want to
    support a free-as-in-speech version as well, but I still need to figure out
    what kind of license I should use. Meanwhile, I hope you'll get some use
    out of the tool even without the source.

    <h3>Screen Shots</h3>
    These screen shots were taken while running JDBC Navigator under Microsoft
    Windows. If you run it under a different operating system, the look and
    feel of the user interface will be different (but the functionality, and
    the user interface layout, will not change).
    <br>
    JDBC Navigator uses the platform's native look and feel by default, but you
    can override the default by adding <code>motif</code>, <code>metal</code>,
    or <code>windows</code> at the end of the command line. Note: the Windows
    look and feel only works under Windows.
