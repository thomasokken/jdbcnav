Copying rows from table editing windows no longer works. Throws exceptions,
though maybe not on the first attempt. Clipboard frame also broken.
UPDATE: the problem is that the Clipboard code is not TypeSpec-aware; I
overlooked it in the great db-independent type handling update in November
2005. Ever since, the code in MyTable that gets cell renderer components for
the clipboard fails, because the copied data has columnClass 'TypeSpec' for all
its columns; MyTable assumes that the underlying model is a ResultSetTableModel
in that case, while it actually is an ArrayTableModel. Boom,
ClassCastException!
Looks like this got broken in build 2239 (12 November 2005).
To fix, ArrayTableModel needs to support TypeSpecs somehow. First guess: define
a new interface, HasTypeSpecs, to be implemented by ResultSetTableModel and by
a new subclass of ArrayTableModel. This new interface should declare one
method, getTypeSpec(int column), to be used by DatabaseObjectRenderer and
DatabaseObjectEditor to get the TypeSpec.
UPDATE: OK, fixed 'Copy' more or less as described above.
Now it turns out that 'Paste' is broken, apparently because the wrong data is
written to the system clipboard or something. I fear the clipboard handling
updates in build 2531 (12 December 2005) may be broken-as-designed.

The PK values used by the 'Select FK Value' command are cached inside the
BasicTable object (in the pkValues member), but there's currently no provision
for invalidating that cache when the table is modified.
The conservative approach would be to run a query *each time* getPKValues() is
invoked.

When MemoryMonitor notices that memory is getting low, in addition to showing a
warning dialog, it should also pause in-progress table loads. Without this, the
low-memory warning may be useless, because a table loading thread may overflow
memory before the user even has time to react to the low-memory warning.
(For now, at least MemoryMonitor could be useful for diagnosing whether certain
problems (flaky table loads?) are due to memory shortages or not).

Revisit BLOB/BINARY handling: does it work correctly with MySQL and Transbase?
Also, revisit the BIT (bit array) type in PostgreSQL. Would be nice if that
were handled in a manner compatible with Transbase's BITS/BITS2 types.

It would be nice to get rid of the JDBC Navigator clipboard, and use the system
clipboard throughout. Since the system clipboard does not support content
change notifications, only flavor change notifications, this means some work
wrt updating the enabled/disabled state of "Paste" commands. Also, it begs the
question how to support "grid" data for import/export.

When opening multiple table editing windows at the same time, and one or more
of them are for tables containing Oracle LONG or LONG RAW columns, the
exception "Stream has already been closed" may occur, or the application may
freeze completely. To avoid this, you must always open tables containing LONG
or LONG RAW columns separately. It would be nice if JDBC Navigator would load
such tables separately automagically; this will require (1) a new Table
property mustBeLoadedSeparately, plus (2) code in BasicDatabase and
JDBCDatabase to load such tables serially (the easiest approach would be to
load them first, before opening all the remaining windows; this will require
a mechanism whereby the Database can keep track of whether any loads are still
in progress). Of course this also affects other tables that might be opened
while a background load of a LONG-containing table is in progress; the solution
will probably have to be something along the lines of a queue.

"Set Password" should make the user type the password twice if it doesn't match
any of the existing ones (i.e., if it does not successfully decrypt any
encrypted connection configs) -- because that means it's a new password, and
there's otherwise the danger that the user could accidentally encrypt all his
connection configs using a mistyped password.

Hourglass cursor for slow operations that block the UI. Maybe also use Windows-
style "hourglass+arrow" cursor for QueryResultFrame while query is in progress.

Progress dialog for Generate Script.

Make "Reload Tree", "Clear Cache", and "Remove Orphans" scriptable, so that
you can mix the SQL embedding and the JDBCNav functionality in one script --
this could be useful for testing etc.

TypeSpec should distinguish between LONG and LOB types; also, it should
maintain a 'size' property for such types. These changes are mostly relevant
for accurate cross-DB SQL script generation, but the 'size' property could also
be used to enforce the constraint when editing cells (this should probably also
be done for the number and string renderers and editors).
