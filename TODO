Loading large queries can cause OutOfMemoryError. These should be caught and a
message displayed to the user. (Currently, all that happens is a message being
printed on standard output by the JVM, where most users will never see it; this
means that the user can't tell the difference between an operation that failed
because it ran out of memory and an operation that is simply taking very long.)
Apart from better user feedback, another reason for catching this error is to
prevent the AWT event thread from dying.

Change window placement code so that windows are always entirely on-screen. The
current behavior is annoying when opening large tables, since such windows are
typically the size of the entire screen, so you always have to move (or zoom)
them before you can use them.

The Windows menu can become too long; should use MenuLayout or some variation
thereof to make it switch to multiple-column mode if necessary.

JavaScript: it should be possible to issue the "Reload Tree" command from a
script.

Oracle INTERVAL type support

Hourglass cursor for windows where long queries are in progress? Use
hourglass+arrow or hourglass+I-beam cursors, like the ones Windows uses to
indicate a slow operation is in progress AND the UI is still active.
