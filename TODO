PostgreSQL INTERVAL type support

Oracle TIMESTAMPLTZ values act weird. It seems like the timestampValue() method
and the Timestamp-consuming constructor are not each other's inverses.

Snapshots and SQL Script generation should use the new database-dependent
object/string conversion mechanism (Database.objectToString() and
Database.stringToObject()).

"Set Password" should make the user type the password twice if it doesn't match
any of the existing ones (i.e., if it does not successfully decrypt any
encypted connection configs) -- because that means it's a new password, and
there's otherwise the danger that the user could accidentally encrypt all his
connection configs using a mistyped password.

Loading large queries can cause OutOfMemoryError. These should be caught and a
message displayed to the user. (Currently, all that happens is a message being
printed on standard error by the JVM, where most users will never see it; this
means that the user can't tell the difference between an operation that failed
because it ran out of memory and an operation that is simply taking very long.)
Apart from better user feedback, another reason for catching this error is to
prevent the AWT event thread from dying.

Hourglass cursor for slow operations that block the UI. Maybe also use Windows-
style "hourglass+arrow" cursor for QueryResultFrame while query is in progess.

Support for additional database products (Transbase, DB2, MySQL).
