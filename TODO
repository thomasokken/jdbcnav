Scenario: open SmallSQL connection, open SQL window, create a table, then do
"Reload Tree". An NPE gets thrown; expanding the "Table" node does not work.

Change window placement code so that windows are always entirely on-screen. The
current behavior is annoying when opening large tables, since such windows are
typically the size of the entire screen, so you always have to move (or zoom)
them before you can use them.

The Windows menu can become too long; should use MenuLayout or some variation
thereof to make it switch to multiple-column mode if necessary.

Oracle INTERVAL type support

Hourglass cursor for windows where long queries are in progress? Use
hourglass+arrow or hourglass+I-beam cursors, like the ones Windows uses to
indicate a slow operation is in progress AND the UI is still active.

MySQL support
