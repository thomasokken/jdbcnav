Oracle INTERVAL type support

Reload Tree does not update table details? Noticed this while using ALTER TABLE
with PostgreSQL.

Loading large queries can cause OutOfMemoryError. These should be caught and a
message displayed to the user. (Currently, all that happens is a message being
printed on standard error by the JVM, where most users will never see it; this
means that the user can't tell the difference between an operation that failed
because it ran out of memory and an operation that is simply taking very long.)
Apart from better user feedback, another reason for catching this error is to
prevent the AWT event thread from dying.

Hourglass cursor for slow operations that block the UI. Maybe also use Windows-
style "hourglass+arrow" cursor for QueryResultFrame while query is in progess.

Support for additional database products (MySQL, DB2, etc.).
